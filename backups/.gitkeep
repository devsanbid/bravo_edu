# Backups Directory

This directory stores database schema backups created by the `backup-database.js` script.

## Files

- `latest-backup.json` - Always contains the most recent backup
- `appwrite-backup-YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS.json` - Timestamped backups

## Important

⚠️ **Keep these files safe!** They contain your entire database schema.

✅ **Recommended**: 
- Store backups in cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- Commit to a private Git repository
- Keep local copies in a secure location

## Restore Instructions

To restore from a backup:

```bash
export APPWRITE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
node scripts/restore-database.js backups/latest-backup.json
```

Or restore from a specific timestamped backup:

```bash
node scripts/restore-database.js backups/appwrite-backup-2025-12-25T10-30-00.json
```
